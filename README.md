This project is a my first run at ML in Python. 

Code is pretty self explanatory, numbers were way too good on baseline tho. Silly mistake to leave columns that literally say withdraw in the main data - big leak that let the model cheat...

once removed i got an approx. 65% correct guess rate which isnt amazing but makes sense as BIO data hardly going to indicate withdrawness. 

The difference in stats from Linear to Randomforest really surprised me tho! This project also really made me realise the limitation of hardware...Test times on a relatively shallow pipeline became pretty long so i can only imagine on a more complex project.
